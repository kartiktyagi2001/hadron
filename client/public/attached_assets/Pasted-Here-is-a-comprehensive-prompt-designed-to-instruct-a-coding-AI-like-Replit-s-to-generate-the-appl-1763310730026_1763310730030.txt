Here is a comprehensive prompt designed to instruct a coding AI (like Replit's) to generate the application we've discussed.

This prompt is structured to be explicit, define the scope, and force the AI to ask you for the specific content it needs, preventing it from making assumptions.

### 🤖 AI Prompt to Generate Your Application

**Project Role:** You are an expert-level full-stack developer. Your task is to build the frontend for a static, professional product showcase website based on the following strict requirements.

**Project Brief:**
The client is **Hadron Electronics**, an Indian electronics manufacturer specializing in Battery Management Systems (BMS). They currently only have an IndiaMart presence and need a professional website to establish digital credibility.

The target audience is **technical engineers** and **B2B clients**, so the final design must be **minimalist, modern, and professional**. It should feel "well-engineered" and precise, not like a generic template. The primary inspiration is `exicom.com` (minimal, confident, with a subtle "electronics touch" like a light grid pattern).

This is a **Phase 1 (MVP) build**. It is a **static site only**. There will be no backend database, user authentication, or e-commerce functionality.

-----

### **Core Requirements**

1.  **Mandatory Tech Stack:**

      * **Framework:** Next.js (using the App Router)
      * **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
      * **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (You **must** use this for buttons, cards, etc.)
      * **Animations:** Framer Motion (for subtle, premium-feeling animations)

2.  **Product Data:**

      * All product information (images, titles, descriptions, specifications) **must** be read from a single local file: `public/data/products.json`. Do not hardcode product data in the components.

3.  **Contact Functionality (MVP):**

      * The contact page must **not** have a functional backend form.
      * Contact methods must be direct links:
          * Email: `mailto:example@hadron.com`
          * WhatsApp: `https://wa.me/91...`
          * Phone: `tel:+91...`

-----

### **File & Component Structure**

Please generate the following file structure:

```
/app
  /about
    page.tsx
  /contact
    page.tsx
  /products
    page.tsx     // This is the Product Grid page
    /[slug]
      page.tsx   // This is the Product Detail page
  layout.tsx     // Root layout
  page.tsx       // Home page
/components
  /layout
    Navbar.tsx
    Footer.tsx
  /ui            // shadcn/ui components will go here
    button.tsx
    card.tsx
    ...
  HeroBanner.tsx
  ProductCard.tsx
  ProductGrid.tsx
/public
  /data
    products.json  // Create a placeholder for this
```

-----

### **Data Structure**

The `public/data/products.json` file must follow this structure. Create a mock-up with 2-3 sample products:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "bms-12s-100a",
    "slug": "bms-12s-100a",
    "title": "BMS 12S 100A (LiFePO4)",
    "shortDescription": "High-current BMS for 12-series LiFePO4 battery packs.",
    "imageUrl": "/images/products/bms-12s.jpg", // Use placeholder images
    "category": "LiFePO4 BMS",
    "specifications": {
      "Voltage": "36V (12S)",
      "Continuous Current": "100A",
      "Peak Current": "200A",
      "Functions": "Over-charge, Over-discharge, Short-circuit protection",
      "Compatibility": "LiFePO4"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "bms-16s-150a",
    "slug": "bms-16s-150a",
    // ... (fill in similar data)
  }
]
```

-----

### **Key Component Specifications**

**1. `HeroBanner.tsx` (Homepage)**

  * **Goal:** Create the "Exicom-inspired" hero.
  * **Layout:** Full-width section with centered text.
  * **Background:** Use a subtle, low-opacity background pattern (like a dot grid or light schematic) to give the "electronics touch."
  * **Content:** A main headline (H1), a sub-headline (p), and a CTA button.
  * **Animation (Framer Motion):**
      * The H1, paragraph, and button should each fade in and slide up slightly on page load.
      * Use `variants` for `opacity: 0, y: 20` animating to `opacity: 1, y: 0`.
      * Stagger the animations (e.g., delay 0.1s, 0.3s, 0.5s).
  * **Components:** Use `shadcn/ui` **Button** for the CTA.

**2. `Navbar.tsx`**

  * **Goal:** Clean, professional, and responsive navigation.
  * **Layout:**
      * **Desktop:** Logo on the left, navigation links (`Home`, `About`, `Products`, `Contact`) in the center, and a "Get in Touch" Button on the right.
      * **Mobile:** Logo on the left, Hamburger Menu icon on the right.
  * **Components:** Use `shadcn/ui` **Sheet** (or Drawer) for the mobile menu.
  * **Styling:** Should have a subtle bottom border or shadow to separate it from the page content.

**3. `ProductCard.tsx`**

  * **Goal:** A reusable card for the product grid.
  * **Components:** Use `shadcn/ui` **Card** component.
  * **Content:**
      * `CardHeader`: Product Image (use Next.js `<Image>`).
      * `CardContent`: Product Title (`<h3>`) and Short Description (`<p>`).
      * `CardFooter`: A "View Details" button.
  * **Animation (Framer Motion):**
      * On hover (`whileHover`), the card should lift slightly (e.g., `scale: 1.03` or `y: -5`).

**4. `ProductGrid.tsx` (`/products/page.tsx`)**

  * **Goal:** Display all products from `products.json`.
  * **Logic:** Fetch and map the JSON data.
  * **Layout:** A responsive CSS grid (e.g., `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`).
  * **Animation (Framer Motion):**
      * Wrap the grid container in a `motion.div`.
      * Use `staggerChildren` on the container so each `ProductCard` fades in one after the other.

**5. `ProductDetail.tsx` (`/products/[slug]/page.tsx`)**

  * **Goal:** Display a single product's details.
  * **Logic:** This is a dynamic page. It must use the `slug` from the URL to find the correct product in `products.json`.
  * **Layout:** A 2-column layout (Image on the left, details on the right).
  * **Content:**
      * Product Title
      * Full Description
      * A list or table of the `specifications` object.
      * An "Inquire Now" button (links to the Contact page).

-----

### **Global Styles & Theme**

  * **File:** `app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`
  * **Typography:**
      * **Headings:** Use a modern, geometric sans-serif font (e.g., Poppins, Manrope). Please import it from Google Fonts in `layout.tsx`.
      * **Body:** Use a highly readable sans-serif font (e.g., Inter).
  * **Colors (Tailwind Config):**
      * Set up the shadcn/ui theme.
      * **Background:** `white`
      * **Text:** A near-black (e.g., `slate-900` or `gray-900`)
      * **Primary/Accent:** A single, strong "Tech Blue" (e.g., `blue-600`). This should be used for all buttons and links.
  * **Layout:** Ensure all page content has a max-width and is centered (e.g., `max-w-7xl mx-auto`) with appropriate padding (e.g., `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`).

### **Context & Missing Information**

I have not provided the following. **You must ask me for this information** before you hardcode any placeholders (other than the product JSON).

  * **Company Content:** The specific "About Us" text.
  * **Contact Details:** The real Phone, Email, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn URL.
  * **Logo:** I will provide an SVG or PNG for the logo.
  * **Product Content:** I will provide the real product images, titles, and descriptions from IndiaMart to replace the `products.json` mock data.
  * **Specific Font Choice:** Do you have a recommendation between Poppins or Manrope for the headings, or should I provide one?
  * **Specific Blue Hex Code:** Do you have a specific "Tech Blue" you recommend, or should I provide one?

Please proceed with generating the scaffolding and components using placeholders where necessary, and confirm the list of information you need from me to complete the project.
